# V29 Design v2: Foolproof Multilingual Dictation + Bangla Spelling Normalization

Status: v2, incorporates both external design reviews (A: language-design critique, B: engineering critique) as binding inputs. Build approved by the maintainer, 2026-09-23.
Grounding: JVM rig reproducing shipped v28d bytes (sha-verified), prod APK smali trace, the maintainer's verbatim field outputs 2026-09-23.
v1 superseded; changes from v1 are marked [REVIEW] and mapped to the originating critique in section 8.

## 1. Confirmed wrong-lock mechanism (unchanged from v1, rig-proven)

- k3 (English layout) cannot convert: byte-identical passthrough on the maintainer's exact sentence. Hook fires only on k2 + voice flag; layout read live from the system InputMethod subtype per call (no stale-layout path).
- Neither field sentence locks on the rig as a clean full utterance; v28d rules behave as designed on clean ASR text.
- Firing mechanism: accent-garbled ASR emission (hwen, rigarding, profeshional, autputted, ting). Dictionary misses classify as strong Bangla; 3+ strong in a chain fires the v28d weight rule; the locked segment converts every trapped English word (the->থে, whole->ওহলে). Rig reproduction: "rigarding the rambler bangla project is it in the profeshional github repo" -> "ঋগারদিং থে রাম্বলের বাংলা project is it in the প্রফেশিওনাল গিথুব রেপো"; "outputted" -> ঔতপুত্তেদ (the maintainer's exact field spelling); ড়াম্বলের implies a "drambler"-class emission.
- Intermittency = per-utterance ASR garble density. Clean emission: zero strong tokens, stays English.

## 2. Architecture (minimum-safe set from engineering review B, adopted in full)

Single choke point: the voice hook (vrh.h) replaces result text with processVoice(text). ALL conversion flows through processVoice; there is no second converter path. V29 components, in call order:

1. VoiceSessionContext - holds the session pin (AUTO/BN/EN), session nonce, lifecycle state. Deterministic destruction (section 4).
2. LocaleRouter - reads the pin ONLY. Never infers a route from first token, script, subtype, or lexical score. Weak/missing/conflicting session metadata = AUTO = v28d byte-identical behavior. [REVIEW]
3. ProtectedSpan pass - identifies protected spans on the ORIGINAL text FIRST: names/capitalized tokens, @handles, emails, URLs, hashtags, code/version strings, ALLCAPS, numbers/dates/phones/times, punctuation offsets. Originals are retained and never rewritten.
4. EvidenceNormalizer - builds NON-DESTRUCTIVE normalized evidence (scoring-only) after the ASR result is delivered, before classify/locks. Original text is never mutated for classification. [REVIEW]
5. SegmentLock (v28d, byte-untouched verdict logic) - classifies on original tokens + scoring-only evidence. Dictionary hits NEVER seed a Bangla lock; a Tier-1 mapping is never a strong anchor. [REVIEW]
6. Renderer - conservative; emits canonical spellings only where section 5 permits; otherwise preserves original surface bytes exactly.

## 3. Lane semantics (explicit pin first; AUTO = v28d + A2)

- EN pin: PURE PASSTHROUGH. Returns the original string before any lookup, classification, or conversion - Tier-1 lookup explicitly suppressed. "A pin means do not touch my text." [REVIEW]
- BN pin: k1-style convert-all PLUS the pre-existing guards: URL/email/@handle/code/number/time spans stay exact. [REVIEW]
- AUTO (default, and the fallback for any weak/missing/conflicting metadata): v28d rules + A2 demotion (section 6). Byte-identical to v28d except the named A2 fixtures. [REVIEW]
- Mixed-segment precedence: real Bangla strong tokens outweigh demoted garbles; a demoted token never blocks a lock that real Bangla strong evidence justifies, and never builds one. [REVIEW]

## 4. Pin lifecycle (session-local, no persistence) [REVIEW]

- Scope: one mic session + the active InputConnection.
- Set: explicit user action in the extension settings surface.
- Reset on: mic stop/cancel/error; InputConnection, editor, or package change; subtype/layout change; IME restart; process death; short inactivity timeout. NEVER changes mid-dictation.
- No durable persistence: nothing written to prefs/disk; process death = AUTO.
- Kill gate: if any cross-field or cross-app pin leak is observed in testing, the pin feature is pulled from the build.

## 5. Fix package B: Bangla spelling normalization (headline feature)

- Tier-1a: canonical roman->script lookup (2,369 pairs, Avro-derived, MPL 2.0) consulted BEFORE the converter, ONLY in normalization lanes (BN pin or BN-locked AUTO segment), ONLY outside protected spans, ONLY on Latin tokens, NEVER on Bangla script. Measured on the shipped jar: 17.1% -> 82.9% byte-exact on covered alpha keys.
- Tier-1b: cmudict-derived (BSD) English loan spellings for uncovered high-frequency loans (732 uncovered top-1k words identified). Each shipped mapping carries provenance (source + derivation) and a regression fixture. [REVIEW]
- Tier-2: fallback chain seed -> Avro parse -> engine converter + permissive wordlist validation (native roundtrip union 44.9% baseline).
- Corpus: spelling-corpus-v1.tsv (52 entries) grows toward ~500 with government standard-spelling derivations. Every shipped pair byte-checked on the rig. No runtime model judgment.

## 6. Fix package A2: garble demotion (bounded, scoring-only) [REVIEW]

- Rule: an original-text token that misses all dictionaries is tested as an English near-miss: BOUNDED edit-distance-1 against the English set, restricted to ASCII alpha tokens length >= 5, with conservative morphology constraints (same first char, same last char, candidate set bucketed by length +/-1) plus an explicit allowlist seeded from the observed field garbles (hwen, rigarding, profeshional, autputted, ting, drambler-class). Phonetic-index candidate DROPPED per review - edit-distance-1 only. [REVIEW]
- Effect: near-miss tokens are demoted from strong-Bangla to NEUTRAL for SCORING ONLY; the original token text is untouched and emitted as-is unless the segment locks for real Bangla reasons.
- Gates (all falsifiable, measured per corpus, not in aggregate): [REVIEW]
  * ZERO false demotions on EVERY protected corpus individually (Bangla strong-word corpus, 1,500 natives, func-word set).
  * ZERO segment-lock DECISION changes on the v28d regression corpus (19-line field corpus + 14 adversarial + punctuation-less suite) except named fixtures listed in the test file. Decisions measured, not token labels.
  * Per-token collision list published with the build report (every English word whose ED1 neighborhood overlaps a Bangla corpus token).
- Renderer note: demoted tokens keep original surface; canonical emission only per section 2 rule 6.

## 7. Budgets, observability, kill gates (measured, release ceiling) [REVIEW]

- Budgets (measured on the shipped APK, not arbitrary): <= 1 MiB compressed APK delta vs v28d; <= 4 MiB additional RSS; <= 5 ms p95 lookup latency on-device (proxy-measured on rig + CI smoke). If any budget fails, the feature shrinks (Tier-1b defers first, then A2 allowlist-only mode).
- Observability: counters and enums ONLY (lane chosen, demotions count, lookup hits count, pin resets by cause) + session nonce. NEVER raw dictated text, URLs, handles, or audio. [REVIEW]
- Kill gates: no auto-route if locale metadata is unobservable or fallback nondeterministic (AUTO always = v28d); destructive dictionary use dies on any protected-span change or standalone lock seed; session pin dies on any cross-field/app leak; any regression-floor breach rolls the build back to v28d behavior.

## 8. HARD PRE-BUILD QUESTION - ANSWERED

Q: Confirm bypass/convert gates occur BEFORE Tier-1 lookup and every converter path, proven with byte-exact passthrough tests (punctuation, apostrophes, emoji, handles, URLs, mixed scripts, whitespace).

A: YES, by construction and by proof:
1. Single choke point: the prod hook (vrh.h) replaces result item text with processVoice(c); archaeology of the shipped dex shows every voice text path converges there (callers kfo:814 / vxr:736 / vzz:318 all route through the same replacement). There is no alternate converter path to leak past the gate.
2. Gate order inside processVoice (V29): (a) VoiceSessionContext/LocaleRouter resolve the lane FIRST; (b) EN pin returns the original string immediately - before ProtectedSpan, before Tier-1 lookup, before SegmentLock, before convertLoan; (c) k3 layout gate (v28d, retained) likewise returns original before any V29 component; (d) Tier-1 lookup exists only inside the BN conversion path, after the lane decision and after protected spans are cut.
3. Proof battery (new rig suite, v29-passthrough): under EN pin, byte-exact passthrough required for: punctuation-heavy text, apostrophes/contractions, emoji and emoji-mixed text, @handles, URLs, mixed Bengali+Latin script, leading/trailing/internal whitespace variants, numbers/dates/times, ALLCAPS, empty and single-char inputs. Same suite run under k3 AUTO. Any byte difference = build fails.
4. Parity proof: AUTO with absent/low/conflicting session metadata runs the full v28d regression corpus and must match v28d output byte-for-byte except the named A2 fixtures.

## 10. Build discipline (unchanged)

Smallest patch on the v28d surface; v28d verdict logic byte-untouched; v27.11 baseline preserved. Full battery on the DEX-derived jar, CI smoke on the exact shipped bytes, signed prod+staging pair, SHA-256 + GoFile + provenance amendment. Release and visibility decisions stay with the maintainer after the field test pass.
